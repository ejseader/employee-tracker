## Installation and Usage

### The app is built in the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) environment, with the npm package [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) handling user prompts, [MySQL2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) handling the SQL code injected into the js files, and [Console.Table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/console.table) returning SQL data to the terminal in an orderly fashion. 

### Please use the following commands to initialize the app and install necessary dependencies:
```
npm init -y 
npm install inquirer mysql2 console.table dotenv
```

### Once installed and you have launched the index.js (with the 'npm start' command), you will be greeted with a start menu for the Employee Tracker Terminal App with a list of options available to the user. <br><br>
